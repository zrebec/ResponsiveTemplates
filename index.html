                <h2>Quest 2: Running out of the water</h2>
                <p>What's the happen with water? It looks the water could be stolen from our water tanks!</p>
                <p>This is a problem for people usually. You're live in small village and most people doesn't have
                access to the water pump from far city. They are reliant to their water tanks.</p>
                <p>One villager found a horses hooves and small brown bag which probably clue (or band) lost.</p>
                <p>The brown bag isn't empty too. You can find there photo a unspecified colored fox because photo is
                grayscale. There are also small embroidery with text <strong>"8528"</strong>. Probably your band
                should find the right fox and show him this code. It could be clue or confederate.</p>
                <p>If you find the right fox, ask him to how you can find the clue of your water?</p>
                <p><strong>But remember, foxes are sly and you never know it his told you the truth.</strong></p>
